# Marks-Predictor
This is my first project on Machine Learning. This project tries to predict semester marks of college students using linear regression. 
It uses 4 features which are Attendance, difficulty level, number of subjects, semester.
  Here diffciculty level is how difficult a particular student find a semester, some student may find a semester easy and instersting       whereas some may find it difficult, uninteresting and boring.
  Semester is basically semester number 1, 2 etc.
It uses features scaling, normalisation.
It also uses regularisation to prevent overfitting.
It tries to fit the features on second order polynomial.
Also this is made using Octave, I think it should also work in Matlab.
