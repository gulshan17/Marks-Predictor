# Marks-Predictor
This is my project on Machine Learning. This project tries to predict semester marks of college students using linear regression. 
It uses 4 features which are Attendance, difficulty level, number of subjects, semester.
It uses features scaling, normalisation.
It also uses regularisation to prevent oervfitting.
It tries to fit the features on second order polynomial.
Also this is made using Octave, I think it should also work in Matlab.
